fire year start = 1985
pre-fire conifer cover > 30%
pre-fire con cov = mean of 3 pre-fire years
post-fire con cov = min of 5 post-fire years
disturbance size > 0.2
had to have a minimum of 5 pixels to upscale to 270 meters
we fit a loess smooth line to the recovery trajectory
we filtered out other disturbance not detected by the medium severity reburns by ignoring pixels where the highest value on the loess smooth line was greater than 50% of the value of ARI_end. span = 1.2

filtered out NF fragments and areas within 200 m of facts polygons
